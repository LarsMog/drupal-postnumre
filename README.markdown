====================

A small collection of modules for dealing with danish postal codes.

Why this module?
----------------

This module tries to provide simple functionality for working with Danish
postal codes. It's not trying to fill the shoes of something like
[addresses.module](http://drupal.org/project/addresses) or
[location.module](http://drupal.org/project/location), in fact I plan to
integrate with both of these in time.

The main reason for creating this module is a very basic need for having
valid postal codes in the database and a user friendly interface for them,
so the primary feature is an AHAH-callback and a validation function that
can be used by other modules.
